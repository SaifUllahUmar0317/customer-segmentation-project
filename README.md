Customer Segmentation using Clustering
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using two clustering algorithms: K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering.

The dataset used is the Mall Customers dataset, which contains features such as Annual Income and Spending Score. By segmenting customers, businesses can better understand customer groups and apply targeted strategies.

🔍 Comparison of K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering

K-Means Clustering:
✅ Efficient, works well for large datasets.
✅ Assigns clusters by minimizing distance to centroids.

Agglomerative Clustering:
✅ Hierarchical, builds clusters step by step.
✅ Provides a dendrogram to help determine cluster count.

➡ Both methods gave similar segmentation results, but:

Agglomerative Clustering offers better interpretability (via dendrogram).

K-Means is computationally faster for large-scale problems.

📊 Business Insights from Clusters

VIP Customers (💎) – High income, high spending
→ Provide premium services & loyalty programs.

Inactive Customers (🚫) – Low income, low spending
→ Don’t spend much marketing budget here.

Balanced Customers – Average income, average spending
→ Cross-sell maintenance services.

Saver Customers (💰) – Low income, cautious spenders
→ Attract with discounts & affordable bundles.

Spender Customers – Spend a lot, but not consistent
→ Target with limited-time offers & personalized deals.
